/*!
* @class SGLocationService 
* @abstract ￼Update and retrieve records from SimpleGeo.
* @discussion ￼All methods that create an HTTP request return a response identifier. The response identifier is used
* to identify which response is being returned when either @link locationService:succeededForResponseId:responseObject: locationService:succeededForResponseId:responseObject: @/link
* or @link locationService:failedForResponseId:error: locationService:failedForResponseId:error: @/link is called for all delegates. The class
* allows multiple records to be registered using @link addDelegate: addDelegate: @/link. Delegates will continue recieving notifications
* so it is important to @link removeDelegate: removeDelegate: @/link when that object no longer wants to recieve notifications.
*
* The location service requires that @link HTTPAuthorizer HTTPAuthorizer @/link be set with a valid instance of @link //simplegeo/ooc/cl/SGOAuth SGOAuth @/link. Since
* the only type of authorization supported by SimpleGeo is OAuth, this property must be set or all HTTP requests will result in an error.
*
* All HTTP requests are sent as NSInvocationOperations. Currently, the SimpleGeo API only offers get/add/delete methods for only a single
* record. When using a method like @link updateRecordAnnotations: updateRecordAnnotations: @/link, a single NSInvocationOperation is used
* to update all of the records. It does not create a new operation for each @link //simplegeo/ooc/cl/SGRecordAnnotation SGRecordAnnotation @/link
* that is passed through.
*
* This interface provides two different avenues when it comes to storing and retrieving records. The first is using the standard
* NSString parameratized methods like @link retrieveRecord:layer: retrieveRecord:layer: @/link. Calling this method
* only requires the knowledge of the desired recordId and the layer to which it belongs to. The alternative method would be to use
* @link retrieveRecordAnnotation: retrieveRecordAnnotation: @/link which requires an NSObject that implements 
* @link //simplegeo/ooc/intf/SGRecordAnnotation SGRecordAnnotation @/link. @link //simplegeo/ooc/cl/SGRecord SGRecord @/link is provided
* as a standard class that implements the protocol. The advantage to using the second method is that everytime a response succeeds,
* the delegate can use the responseObject that is passed in via @link locationService:succeededForResponseId:responseObject: locationService:succeededForResponseId:responseObject: @/link
* to update the SGRecord by calling @link //simplegeo/ooc/instm/SGRecord/updateRecordWithGeoJSONObject: updateRecordWithGeoJSONObject: @/link.
