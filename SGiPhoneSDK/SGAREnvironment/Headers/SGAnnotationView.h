/*!
* @class SGAnnotationView
* @abstract Used to display information about @link //simplegeo/ooc/intf/SGRecordAnnotation/SGAnnotation SGAnnotation @/link in an AR enviornment.
* @discussion SGAnnotationViews are the only views that can be rendered in the @link //simplegeo/ooc/cl/SGARView SGARView @/link.
* The annotation view has two different modes, when it is being inspected and when it is not being inspected. You can toggle through
* inspection modes by calling @link inspectView: inspectView: @/link. When an annotation view is created it calls @link inspectView: inspectView: @/link
* on itself with the value NO. When NO is specifed the view enters into target mode. If YES is passed into @link inspectView: inspectView: @/link, the view switches
* to inspect mode.
* Target mode is intended to be just a target in in the AR enviornment; something that allows the user to inspect further by generating a touch event. When
* a touch event occurs on an annotation view, @link shouldInspectAnnotationView: shouldInspectAnntationView: @/link is called. Anytime throughout the life-cycle of
* the view, you can call @link inspectView: inspectView: @/link and it will change its subviews properly, independent of its enviornment.
* A SGAnnotationView has two display enviornments. The first is within the augmented reality view. The second is as a UIView was intended, using CoreAnimation. When the view is within
* the AR enviornment, the orign within the @link frame frame @/link is ignored. The AR enviornment must place the view based on its relative position of the device and
* the coordinate obtained from @link annotation annotation @/link. When the annotation view is rendered as a UIView, in most cases,
* it will be a subview of @link SGARView SGARView @/link.
