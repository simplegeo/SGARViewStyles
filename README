ARViewStyles

================================================================================
ABSTRACT:

This project demonstrates the different ways to implement and use the augmented
reality (AR) library in the SGiPhoneSDK. The library is completely independent from the
SGLocationService.

Different Styles:

1. Default - This is just the default style. SGAnnotationView are present as red pins
while the radar mantains its default images. When pins are touched, the default inspect
behavior occurs where the view is removed from the AR enviornment and then added as a 
subview of the ARView.

2. Forest - This style sets the SGAnnotationViews into inspect mode while being
present in the AR enviornment. It can be considered to be the reverse of the default style.
When the SGAnnotationView is touched, it is removed from the AREnvironment, placed into,
target mode and then added as a subview of the SGARView.

3. Damsels in Distress - There are two types of SGAnnotationViews used here. One with
a static position and another that changes everytime the SGAnnotationView needs to be
redrawn. The main note to take away from this style is that SGAnnotationViews can move
around within the AR enviornment and still be represented properly by the radar.

4. Kettle + Escher - SGAnnotationViews allow subclasses to draw themselves in OpenGLES.
Instead of setting up the subview layout, we just load in the teapot vertices and normals
and we are able to draw the teapot model in the proper location.

Note: At the moment this is throw-away code. Plans to make things nice-and-pretty 
will happen very soon.

PACKAGING LIST:

SGARViewStylesAppDelegate
Standard AppDelegate implementation. Once the applicationDidFinishLaunching: is 
called, the SGStylesViewController is added to the main window.

SGStylesViewController
This is the main view controller for the application; it is in charge of configuring
styles and loading the AR enviornment. Each style is setup using there own
configuration method, see #pragma Style config methods. Since there is no reset
button for the AR enviornment, each setting must be addressed in order to produce 
the proper style.

SGSimpleAnnotation
A simple class that implements the SGAnnotation protocol. Its used to provide
a title and subtitle for SGAnnotationViews when they are inspected.

SGForestAnnotationView
Initalizes the SGAnnotationView with a randomly chosen forest critter and then
uses one of the view properties (distance, coordinate or bearing) to display
as the title while in inspect mode.

SGDistressedDamselAnnotationView
Setups up the SGAnnotationView to have the glassy style along with a random
princess to be used as the target image.

SGKettleAnnotationView
This SGAnnotationView draws itself. By setting enableOpenGL to YES and implementing
drawAnnotationView, we are able to render a model at the proper location in the AR
enviornment. The AR library will ask to SGAnnotationView to draw itself at the origin.
It will then apply the proper transformations to place the model inside the enviornment.

SGGargoyleAnnotaitonView
A random scary SGAnnotationView that increments its position in the AR enviornment.
It does something tricky though. It overrides the annotation get property and does
some readjustment to the coordinate. Everytime the view needs to be drawn, the annotaiton
is accessed to obtain the coordinate of the view.
